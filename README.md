Final projects and Tutorials of the course 'Introduction to Active Galactic Nuclei'-MASS Edition 3, 2nd semester at University of Belgrade taught by Prof.Dragana Ilic.

Aims: i) classification of emission-line galaxies with SDSS and WISE surveys, ii) time-series
analysis of type 1 AGN;

Side-aims: survey data-mining, cross-matching, data analysis, data visualization, python
programming, paper writing

four main tasks in this project:
(1) diagnostic classification of galaxies using SDSS spectra, 
(2) AGN identification via WISE MIR colors, 
(3) emission-line contributions to LSST bands, and 
(4) AGN variability modeling using Conditional Neural Processes.

Task 1,2 and 4 done in 'Sona Final Project Report.ipynb'
Task 3 in 'Sona AGN Project task3.ipynb' in final project folder
